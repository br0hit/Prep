The Kingdom's Quest for Ancestral Knowledge In the ancient kingdom of Algoria, a vast forest spreids across the land and the kingdom's prosperity is intertwined with the mystical tree of kribwledge. This enchanted bree, known as the Algorian Thee, holds immense power and wisdom within its many nodes Fach node of the tree contains a magical vahe that represents a piece of the kingdoms hentage TIMA You have been given the task of uncovering secrets hidden within the Algorian Tree. The King has issued a decree that you mint answer various quemes about the tree to aid in the kingdom's governance and protection. Three Structure 1. The Tree • The Algorian Tree consists of N nodes (1 N 200,000) Each node i holds a magical value a[i] (1a[i] 1,000,000,000) The tree is connected by N-1 mystical paths (edges) that link pairs of nodes (UV). where each path connects nodes U and V. Queries 2. Royal Queries: The King has Q queries (1 << 200,000) for you to answer. • Each query is represented by three integers (UVwI) U and V are nodes in the tree. wt is a magical threshold value. Objective For each royal query (UV,WI), determine how many nodes in the path from node U to node V (inclusive) have values less than or equal to wl. Function Description Complete the solve function. This function takes the following five parameters and returns an array of size Q, representing the answer to each query N. An integer representing the number of nodes magic value. An array of size N, where each element decotes the magic value value of a node road. An amay of N-1 arrays, where each sub-array represents a path ledge) between two nodes An integer representing the number of queries queries: An array of Q arrays, where each sub-array represents a query with three integers U, V, and wi. Input Format for Custom Testing Use this input format if you are testing against custom insut or writing code in a language where boilerplate code is not provided. 1. The first line contains N denoting the number of nodes. 2. The second line contains N space-separated integers denoting the magic value of nodes 3. The next N-1 lines contain two integers U and V each, which means that there is a branch connecting nodes U and V 4. The next line contains an integer Q. the number of queries 5. The next Q lines contain three integers U, V, w1. Output Format Print lines of output, each line representing the answer to the corresponding query. Output Formsat Print lines of output, each ine presenting the answer to the corresponding query.
